## Project Structure

### Backend (Django)

- **`models.py`**: Defines core structures like `User`, `Income`, `Expense`, and `CreditCardExpense` to capture user data and transactions.
- **`views.py`**: Handles data processing, validation, and CRUD operations, with key views for `ExpenseViewSet` and `IncomeViewSet`.
- **`serializers.py`**: Converts models to JSON and validates data, particularly for recurring payments and installment handling.
- **`urls.py`**: Configures API endpoint paths to provide a RESTful experience.
- **`tests.py`**: Unit tests for models, views, and endpoints ensure functionality and reliability.

### Frontend (React)

- **`App.js`**: Main component handling routing and layout with authentication checks.
- **`components/`**: Modular components like `ExpenseForm`, `CalendarView`, and `Dashboard` for reuse.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom hooks such as `useAuth` for state management and `useMutation` for data handling.
- **`services/`**: API logic is centralized here, simplifying HTTP requests.
- **`tests/`**: Jest tests for component rendering, user interactions, and event handling to guarantee consistent user experience.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, scalable database solution suitable for handling complex queries.

## Design and Testing Choices

### Docker and Railway Deployment

Using **Docker**, the project runs in isolated containers, ensuring stability and making it easier to catch deployment-specific issues early on. **Railway** offers seamless, cloud-based deployment, enabling production-ready hosting and accessibility across all environments.

### Authentication and Security

Djangoâ€™s authentication is paired with frontend checks to secure sensitive areas. Clean, modern designs for the login and registration pages enhance usability.

### Testing Strategy

The project is fully tested using Djangoâ€™s testing framework for the backend and Jest for the frontend. Rigorous testing covers all functionalities to ensure a reliable and bug-free experience.

### User Interface

Material-UI provides a cohesive design language, while custom styles improve responsiveness and accessibility, making the app intuitive and appealing.

### Challenges

- **Recurring Transactions**: A `RecurringChangeLog` model enables flexible updates to recurring incomes/expenses without altering historical data.
- **Credit Card Installments**: Dynamic calculation ensures accurate installment distribution across future months based on installment periods and surcharges.
