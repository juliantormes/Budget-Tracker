# Budget Tracker Project ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼

## Overview

Welcome to the **Budget Tracker Project**! This web application provides a straightforward, efficient way for individuals to manage their finances by tracking income, expenses, and budget goals. Built with Python, Django, and React, the application uses PostgreSQL as its database for reliable data handling. Docker is used to streamline development and testing, making the project production-ready and adaptable to different environments.

With features like customizable dashboards, income and expense categorization, credit card management, and calendar views, the Budget Tracker project is a comprehensive personal finance tool.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and account management provide a personalized, private budgeting experience.
   
2. **Dashboard Overview**: A data-driven dashboard with charts and graphs offers insights into income and spending trends, helping users understand their financial health.

3. **Expense Management**: Users can add, edit, delete, and categorize expenses to track spending patterns and set budget goals effectively.

4. **Income Tracking**: Income logging with categorization allows users to monitor month-over-month income and sources.

5. **Credit Card Management**: This feature supports credit card transaction tracking, including recurring payments and installment handling, for a complete view of financial obligations.

6. **Calendar Integration**: The calendar view offers a monthly overview, helping users manage income and expenses on specific dates.

7. **Comprehensive Testing**: The application includes tests for both backend and frontend code, ensuring a stable and reliable user experience.

## Project Structure

### Backend (Django)

- **`models.py`**: Defines core data structures like User, Income, Expense, and CreditCardExpense, capturing user data and transaction details.
  
- **`views.py`**: Handles requests, data validation, and model interactions. Key views include `ExpenseViewSet` and `IncomeViewSet` for CRUD operations.

- **`serializers.py`**: Converts models to JSON and validates incoming data for API responses, especially for recurring payments and installments.

- **`urls.py`**: Configures API endpoint paths, providing a RESTful experience.

- **`tests.py`**: Contains unit tests for models, views, and endpoints to ensure reliability and accurate functionality.

### Frontend (React)

- **`App.js`**: Main component managing routing and page layout, including authentication checks.

- **`components/`**: Reusable components like `ExpenseForm`, `CalendarView`, and `Dashboard`.

- **`hooks/`**: Custom hooks such as `useAuth` for state management and `useMutation` for data operations.

- **`services/`**: Centralized API call logic, simplifying HTTP request management.

- **`tests/`**: Jest tests for component rendering, user interaction, and event handling.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, production-ready database chosen for handling complex queries and scalability.

## Design and Testing Choices

### Docker for Development and Testing

Docker is integrated into the development process to simulate production environments, making it easy to run, test, and deploy the application across different systems. With Docker, the application can be tested in isolated containers, ensuring consistency and helping to catch deployment-specific issues early.

### Authentication and Security

Djangoâ€™s built-in user model is used for authentication, with frontend components safeguarded by authentication checks. The login and registration pages feature a clean, modern design.

### Testing Strategy

Testing is managed with Djangoâ€™s testing framework for backend and Jest for frontend, ensuring comprehensive validation of functionalities and user interactions.

### User Interface

Material-UI components ensure a consistent design across pages, and custom styles improve the user experience. The interface is optimized for both responsiveness and accessibility.

### Challenges

- **Recurring Transactions**: Recurring expenses and incomes needed flexible updating without altering historical data. This was managed with a `RecurringChangeLog` model.

- **Credit Card Installments**: Distributing installments across future months was achieved through dynamic calculation based on installment periods and surcharges.
