## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Django
- **Charts:** Chart.js
- **Database:** SQLite (with plans to incorporate additional free DB options suitable for production)
- **Testing:** Integration with PyTest pending
- **Architecture:** Refactoring towards a clean architecture with CQRS pattern for separation of read and write operations
